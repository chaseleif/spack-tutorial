Package Testing Tutorial
=========================

This tutorial walks you through the steps for adding and running Spack
package tests during and after the software installation process.

A package that *appears* to install successfully may not actually be
installed correctly or continue to work indefinitely. There are a number
of possible reasons. For example, the installation process may not have
fully installed the software. The installed software may not work. Or the
software may work right after it is installed but, due to system changes,
it stops working days, weeks, or months later. So Spack provides features
for `checking installed software
<https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_packaging.html>`_.

Recall from `Package Creation
<https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_packaging.html>`_
that Spack packages are installation scripts, or recipes, for building
software. As such, they are well suited for also encapsulating recipes
for testing.

Tests can be performed at two phases in the life of an installed
package: build-time and stand-alone. `**Build-time** tests
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#build-time-tests>`_
run as part of the package installation process. `**Stand-alone** tests
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#stand-alone-or-smoke-tests>`_
run at any point after the software is installed. We will cover
adding both to a simple package.

---------------
Getting started
---------------

First confirm you have three environment variables set as follows:

* ``SPACK_ROOT``: consisting of the path to your Spack installation;
* ``PATH``: including ``$SPACK_ROOT/bin`` (so calls to the ``spack``
  command work); and
* ``EDITOR``: containing the path of your preferred text editor (so
  Spack can run it when we modify the package).

The first two variables are automatically set by ``setup-env.sh`` so,
if they aren't, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ . ~/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

You'll also need to create the ``EDITOR`` environment variable if it is
not set.

In order to avoid modifying your Spack instance with changes from this
tutorial, let's add a **package repository** called ``spack-tests``
just for this tutorial by entering the following command:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/testing/repo-add.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

Doing this ensures changes we make here do not adversely affect other
parts of the tutorial. You can find out more about repositories at
`Package Repositories
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html>`_.

-------------------------
Creating the package file
-------------------------

Let's start with a fairly complete ``TBD`` example from the
`Package Creation Tutorial
<https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_packaging.html#>`_.
It is an `AutotoolsPackage
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_systems/autotoolspackage.html#>`_
so there are standard features we will consider leveraging (later)
in testing.

Spack will create a suitable template when you run ``spack create``
with the software's repository URL by entering:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/testing/TBD-create.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

You should now be in your text editor of choice, with the ``package.py``
file open for editing. Let's replace **all** of the templated contents
with the following:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/testing/1.package.py
   :caption: TBD/package.py (from outputs/testing/1.package.py)
   :language: python

and save the results.

-----------------------
Adding build-time tests
-----------------------

Let's first install the package before proceeding to add build-time
tests.  We'll do this by entering the ``spack install`` command:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/testing/TBD-install-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

More information

This tutorial only scratches the surface of adding package tests. For
more information, take a look at the Spack resources below.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Package test features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Build-time tests
  <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#build-time-tests>`_: sanity and installation phase checks
* `Built-in installation phase tests
  <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#id22>`_: standard build-time test checks (when available)
* `Stand-alone (or smoke) tests
  <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#stand-alone-or-smoke-tests>`_: re-using, customizing, and inheriting checks

Spack commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `spack test
  <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_index.html#spack-test>`_: stand-alone (or smoke test) availability and execution

Cleaning up
-----------

Before leaving, let's ensure what we have done does not interfere with
your Spack instance or future sections of the tutorial. Undo the work
by entering the following commands:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/testing/cleanup.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,3,5
